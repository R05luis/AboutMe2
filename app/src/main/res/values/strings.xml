    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Luis Rodrigues
    \n\nI love fish
    \n\nThe Kind that is alive and swins around in aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    \n\nFun fact is that I have sereval aquarius and also a river.
    \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish, Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
    \n\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
    \n\n And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\nnOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry. I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    \n\nI will be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \n\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
